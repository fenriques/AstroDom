# AstroDom
Astro(nomy) Dom(ine) is a catalogue for deep sky images. It scans the directories where images (FITS format only) are 
stored and reads information from FITS headers. 
Additional parameter like FWHM, Eccentricity, Noise can be added from Pixinsight CSV exports.
The catalogue can be used to keep track of your imaging sessions and to benchmark your images.
